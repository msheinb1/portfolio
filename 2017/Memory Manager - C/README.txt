Completed Fall 2017

Project Description: Simulates a memory manager using linked lists and arrays.

Skills used: Coding within certain parameters (naming conventions, what a function needs to return, certain functions already coded), linked list, writing my own test code.

Comments: As this was a program assigned that included a template, many comments were already there when I put in the code. This was one of the few C projects I completed, but I prefer C++ to C.
