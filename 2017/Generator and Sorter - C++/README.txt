Project Description: Generator and Sorter programs. The generator program generates random numbers, the sorter program sorts them and counts the number of times a certain set of characters appear in the list of numbers. The output of the Generator program is meant to become the input of the sorter program.
The generator program uses switch statements and getopt method to generate up to 1,000,000 random numbers from 0 to 1,000,000 and write them to the terminal or to an output file. The sorter program uses switch statements and getopt method to input and sort up to 1,000,000 numbers from 0 to 1,000,000. The input numbers can either be input manually or parsed from an input file.

Skills used: Dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, variable argument lists, program pipeline.

Thoughts: Hadn't used the getlogin() function before, it was interesting to see how you could use it. I also hadn't used the switch and getopt function before. I think I did alright with using them. Aside from that, this program wasn't anything I hadn't seen before, so overall it was a nice and relaxing program to make.
