Project Description: Uses a macro to mimic the functionality of a double ended queue (Deque).

Skills used: Coding within certain parameters (no objects, no classes, must be a macro), macros, tokens, macro expansions.

Comments: When executing the test code, please be aware it takes about 5 seconds to finish.
The test code was supplied.
I created the deque using int values at first. Then I duplicated that file, and converted the duplicate file to a macro.
