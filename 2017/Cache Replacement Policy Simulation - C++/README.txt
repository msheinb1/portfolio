Project Description: This program mimics a cache, and tests out different cache replacement policies on different cache sizes. The cache replacement algorithms used are optimum page replacement, least recently used page replacement, first in first out page replacement, random page replacement, and clock page replacement.

Skills used: Dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, Linked List

Thoughts: I probably could have made the clockBit array with booleans instead. I also probably could have had a single array combining the clockBit and cache array for the clock page replacement algorithm instead.
